The Hardware and Firmware was designed by Sparkfun
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14449
It is the SparkFun Variable Load Kit "KIT-14449"

I did not like there application bootloader, so i updated it

There is some short commings of the board,
1. LCD goes over touch buttons
2. No measurements of the temprature of the battery while discharging
3. No Active cooling, for long running tests

I want to use this Variable Load to test battery capacities.
This will tell me if the battery specs are correct
And I can see how a battery has deteriorated

I hope this project can help other people too.
